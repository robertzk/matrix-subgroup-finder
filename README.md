## Find finite subgroups of matrix groups ![travis](https://api.travis-ci.org/robertzk/matrix-subgroup-finder.svg)

*Note: This project is in initial development and not currently functional.*

This is a C++ utility to find finite matrix groups over certain number fields.
The subgroups considered fall within `GL(n, C)`, where `GL` represents the 
[general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group) and
`C` represents the complex numbers. Further improvements will support restricting
to the four classes of [classical groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_group):
the [orthogonal groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group), 
[unitary groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_group),
[special linear groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_linear_group),
and the [symplectic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_group).

### Development

To get started, run the standard:

```bash
./configure && make && make install
```

**Later instructions will be added upon project progression.**
